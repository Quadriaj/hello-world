# hello-world

My name's Quadri Agboluaje,
i'm a tech enthusiast and a designer and soon to be front-end developer.
my likes duel within the science, tech and art sphere.
Might you also know, I'm Martian.
Favorite earthling food is Jollof rice, the texture and taste is wayyy superior to that on mars.
I like reading articles on Medium, doodling, dancing, listening to preferably electronic music but i'd settle to any other music that gives me energy, all while i'm less busy.
